Please made your own config because all the anticheats listed below are extremely anti-legit.  
For 1 anticheats, Grim is good for pvp servers, Vulcan is good for survival servers.  
For 2 anticheats, I recommend some anticheat combos like Grim+NCP / Vulcan+NCP / Matrix+NCP / Vulcan+Grim / etc.  
For 3 anticheats, use Grim+NCP and choose one between Vulcan and Matrix will be good.  
For 4 anticheats, you definitely got insane server base for this decision.

# GrimAC  
[Download](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/grim-anticheat.99923/)  
Basically the best free option out there, with one of the best simulation/movement checks on the internet. Also detects any reach, even more consistent than others like karhu.  

# NoCheatPlus  
[Download](https://ci.codemc.io/job/Updated-NoCheatPlus/job/Updated-NoCheatPlus/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/target/NoCheatPlus.jar) / [ProtocolLib](https://github.com/dmulloy2/ProtocolLib) is highly recommended.  
The anticheat itself isn't good at all, but pretty good being a secondary one, since it patches almost all of the exploits of vanilla bugs and other anticheat bypasses.    

# Vulcan  
[Download](https://www.mediafire.com/file/jenyttggjao9hf3/Vulcan-2.8.5.jar/file)  
Jacks of all trades, master of none. The free version was released by Frap (Vulcan owner) himself to patch the operation exploit for the cracked plugin users.  

# Matrix  
[Download](https://github.com/Super-Macintosh/matrix-trial-archive/raw/main/Matrix_6.7.0_release.jar) / [PacketEvents](https://modrinth.com/plugin/packetevents) and [ProtocolLib](https://github.com/dmulloy2/ProtocolLib) are necessary.  
Pretty outdated, but got a KillAura detecting bot that clients like Vape can't bypass. It's a free trail version used to be in the Matrix's website but got discontinued.
