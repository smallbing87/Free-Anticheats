  The anticheat itself isn't good at all, but pretty good being a secondary one, since it patches almost all of the exploits of vanilla bugs and other anticheat bypasses.    

# GrimAC

Basically the best free option out there, with one of the best simulation/movement checks on the internet. Also detects any reach, even more consistent than others like karhu.  

# Vulcan

Jacks of all trades, master of none. The free version was released by Frap (Vulcan owner) himself to patch the operation exploit for the cracked plugin users.  

# Matrix  
[Download](https://github.com/Super-Macintosh/matrix-trial-archive/raw/main/Matrix_6.7.0_release.jar)  
Pretty outdated, but got a KillAura detecting bot that clients like Vape can't bypass. It's a free trail version used to be in the Matrix's website but got discontinued.
